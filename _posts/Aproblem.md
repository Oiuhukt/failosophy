I'm a PhD student in philosophy, therefore, I'm accustomed to think about problems that most of the people do not care about. Problemas tha seem to lack any importance at all. But solving these problems does makes a difference: students like me can eat. But today I want to talk about a problem that doesn't really exist.

The problem I'm referring is the response that the Oblivion fandom had to the gender classification system. I doesn't need a solution beacause is something I really do not care about.
But, \emph{if it} were a problem, this is the way I would solve it.
The problem I'm mentioning is the one about biological sex

It \emph{doesn't exist}, I swear. But it seems to be something that a lot of people care about. They care so much, that the problem has been solved a lot of times. So, if someone ask for my opinion\footnote{Of course I'm assuming that this would never happen.} ---the solution--- would look like this.
